    Welcome to Propel Studios. This space is an organizational push by me (Chris) to archive, maintain and showcase projects that I am involved or interested in. This a creative space for me to showcase both my professional endeavours as well as some fun projects I am working on in the sphere of game and app development. You might find a wide find a wide variety of work here depending on what skillset I am trying to hone in on, but mostly you'll find reactive web design, publications and leafletized GIS applications
    I hold a Master's degree in Geology from the University of Alberta. I characterized the geothermal potential of reservoirs in Hinton and more recently Swan Hills. The majority of my expertise comes in the form of Canadian geothermal development, 3-D reservoir reconstruction and large dataset management/analysis. I have been programming for the better part of 10 years and have built programs in a variety of languages whilst using a variety of libraries and API's. These days I have settled on Javascript for development and python for scripting / data analysis. The Propel website itself is a React.js project hand-built by me! I am also a technical writer who has written manuals on modeling software workflows.
